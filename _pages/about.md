I am a joint PhD student in Electrical Engineering at the [PSI research division](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) of the faculty of Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven and the [ICTEAM research institute](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) at UC Louvain. 
Here, I research the use of *radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes* under the supervision of Renaud Detry (KU Leuven) and Christophe De Vleeschouwer (UC Louvain).

I received both my BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering at the [KU Leuven faculty of Engineering Science](https://eng.kuleuven.be/en) and did a semester exchange at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland.
